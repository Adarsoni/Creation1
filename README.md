# Revenue Trend Analysis
I have completed this project as a part of my learning!

## Problem Statement

A multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States, wants to analyze its revenue trends over the past year to identify patterns and make informed business decisions. 
They have a database that contains transactional data including transaction dates and total sales amounts. The store management wants to visualize these trends using Power BI Desktop for better insights and decision-making.

## Approach

Develop a Power BI report/dashboard to visualize the revenue trends over the past year.

Display monthly revenue trends using appropriate visualizations (e.g., line chart, area chart).
Include filters to allow users to analyze revenue trends by different time frames (e.g., month, quarter, year).
Identify any significant patterns or anomalies in the revenue data.

Provide comparative analysis of revenue trends across different product categories or geographical regions, if applicable.

Incorporate slicers or interactive elements to facilitate dynamic exploration of revenue trends by category or region.
